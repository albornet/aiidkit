# AIIDKIT project

AIIDKIT uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers to process medical patient data for kidney graft infection prediction. It aims to provide accurate and interpretable infection risk assessments.

## Features

- **Graph-based patient modeling** to capture complex relationships in medical data.
- **Transformer-based contextual learning** for enhanced risk prediction.
- **Interpretable AI insights** to support clinical decision-making.
