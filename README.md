# AIIDKIT project

AIIDKIT is a uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers to process medical patient data for kidney graft infection prediction. It aims to provide accurate and interpretable infection risk assessments.

## Features

- **Graph-based patient modeling** to capture complex relationships in medical data.
- **Transformer-based contextual learning** for enhanced risk prediction.
- **Interpretable AI insights** to support clinical decision-making.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch, PyG (PyTorch Geometric)
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
